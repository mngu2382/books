Most of us are unprepared for death. In the Buddhist sense, this is
much more that about being at peace with oneself and the world at the
moment of death (although hugely important). In the process of death
one's soul goes through a series stages,  the manner with which one
faces these stages (along with one's karma) determine the quality of
one's rebirth.

The person that is dying is pretty much the same person as they have
lived: though the strength of habit, our reactions to event in death
would be the same reactions to similar events while living. On this
basis, the first part of the book describes that accumulated Buddhist
wisdom of how life should be lived.
