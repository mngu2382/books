_September, 2014_

Author/Narrator's voice strong and vivacious, nearly always engaging.
His voice and style is what I enjoy the most about Dickens.

A very long book, and I do tend to agree with the opinion that the
American interlude was unnecessary.

Charismatic as the narrator is, I didn't become engaged with the plot
and characters until Pinch leaves Pecksniff (more than halfway
through).The change in Pinch from Pecksniff's differential boarder
to an assertive and outspoken chap on his visit to his sister was
unexpected (also incongruous) and quite marvellous, making me feel
that Pinch, and not young Martin Chuzzlewit, is the leading
protagonist.
