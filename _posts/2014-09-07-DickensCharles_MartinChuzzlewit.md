_September, 2014_

Author/Narrator's voice strong and vivacious, nearly always engaging.

A very long book, and I do tend to agree with the opinion that the
American interlude was unnecessary.

Charismatic as the narrator is, I didn't become engaged with the plot
and characters until Pinch leaves Peckersniff. The change in Pinch
from Peckersniff's differential boarder to an assertive and outspoken
chap on his visit to his sister was unexpected and quite marvellous,
making me feel that Pinch, and not young Martin Chuzzlewit, is the
leading protagonist.
