_November, 2014_

A fictionalized recount of the trio that existed between Olga
Kosakievicz (to whom the book is dedicated), Sartre and de Beauvoir
and narrated from the latter's point of view.

Fay Weldon in an afterword for this edition of the book writes

> It quite takes your breath away with its particular mixture of pain,
> excitement and description ...

This line struck me, as it resonated sympathetically with my own
response to the book, though I would go further and say that I found
the book suffocating. The fraught dynamic, where one of the trio's
mood can in an instant swing from self-satisfaction to distress,
caused minor gesture or off-the-cuff reply from another of the trio,
whether the intent was innocent or malicious; this continual drama I
found frustratingly unfathomable.

Although de Beauvoir's unfliching protrayal of the trio is very
admirable, I found reading the novel a bit of a slog.

__Aside:__ Poor print quality.
