A fictionalized recount of the trio that existed between Olga
Kosakievicz (to whom the book is dedicated), Sartre and de Beauvoir
and narrated from the latter's point of view.

Fay Weldon in an afterword for this edition of the book writes

> It quite takes your breath away with its particular mixture of pain,
> excitement and description ...

This line struck me, as it resonated sympathetically with my own
response to the book, though I would go further and say that I found
the book suffocating. The fraught dynamic, where one of the trio's
mood swings from self-satisfaction to distress through minor gesture
or off-the-cuff reply from another of the trio, of both the innocent
and malicious kind, that I continually found frustratingly
unfathomable.

Although de Beauvoir's unfliching protrayal of the trio is very
admirable, I could not find reading the novel a satisfying experience.

__Aside:__ Poor print quality.
