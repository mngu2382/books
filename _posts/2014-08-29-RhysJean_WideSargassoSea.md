_May, 2014_

Short book, sharp style. Telling the story of mad Mrs. Rochester in
Jane Eyre.

Interesting exploration of race, post-colonialism and feminism.

Hereditary madness (cf. _Strange Interlude_, Eugene O'Neil): cannot
but feel incredulous.

This Penguin edition contains a lot of unimpressive "value-add"
material, probably because the text itself is so slight. (TODO:
examples number of footnotes, pages of front and end matter.)
