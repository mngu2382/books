_Feburary, 2015_

Harold and Claudia Lindgard have recieved the news that their son,
Duncan, has been arrested for murder. In their middle ages and members
of the white upper middle class, Harold and Claudia's confusion over
how their son could be capable of taking a life is the kernel of the
book. Set in a young post-apartheid South Africa, race, class, capital
punishment, gun control and gang violence are all live issues and
touch upon at various points.

I definitely did not give the book the attention it deserved, but
will still say that I found it unremarkable.
