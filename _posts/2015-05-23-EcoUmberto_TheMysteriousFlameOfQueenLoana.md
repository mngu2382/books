_May 2015_

We are introduced to our hexagenerian, Milanese, antique book dealer
and protagonist Yambo, as he wakes up in hospital after some
undisclosed accident. And it seems that he has recovered well enough,
except that he has lost all of his personal memories, so that, while
he can rattle off facts about Napoleon and quote T.S. Eliot, Yambo
cannot recall his own name, or that he is a husband, father and
grandfather.

For the rest of the book, we follow Yambo as he tries to reconstruct
his past. He goes back to his childhood home, where his past in the
form of toys, books, comics, diary, vinyl records, etc., have been
preserved. Re-reading the books and re-listening records, Yambo tries
to imagine what it was like to be him growing up in fascist Italy.

Interesting, but not great. Yambo's life is certainly punctuated by
events intriguing to discover, but also included are numerous, what I
guess I will uncharitably call, mundane details (e.g.,
quoting in full song lyrics, descriptions of magazine covers and tin
boxes, etc.) -- details too remote from my experience to find
interesting, but I guess will conjure great nostalgia in others.

Eco's intertextual style comes off as academic to start, but I guess I
got use to it.
