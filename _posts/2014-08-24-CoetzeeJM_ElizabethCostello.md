_November, 2013_

A collection of short stories about preemminent and aging author
Elizabeth Costello. Not particularly impressed with the writing, seems
that the stories are much more focused on enunciating (preaching?)
ideas, most notably on livestock welfare. Other themes also includes
religon and the protrayal of evil in literature.

I hardly ever empathized with Costello; the stories that I enjoyed
the most where the ones that included Costello's son or sister,
where the interaction between Costello and her family really brings
out, with dramatic power, the complexity of her character. At other
times she doesn't come across as much more than a grumpy old lady.
