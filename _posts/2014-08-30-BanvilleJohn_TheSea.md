Ornate language. The quote by Martin Amis of the cover resonates:

> He is a master, and his prose gives continuous sensual delight

With a intriguing twist at the end (cf. Atonement, Ian McEwan), giving
the readers something to talk about I guess. I didn't find it
necessary, almost gratuitous.

Protagonist, Max Morden, recently lost his wife. They're old. Still in
mourning, and probably in an attempt to distract himself, he revisits
another traumatic event, something that happend in his youth.

Fey twins; one dumb, the other a tomboy. They share a strong psychic
link, often understanding each other without needing words.
