Ornate language. The quote by Martin Amis of the cover resonates:

> He is a master, and his prose gives continuous sensual delight

At times though, instead of being involved and delighted by the
writing, I find myself dis-involved and thinking "I see what you're
trying to do here", experiences I had before (Seek My Face, John
Updike and Be Near Me, Andrew O'Hagan) and a distraction from any
enjoyment.

With a intriguing twist right at the end (cf. Atonement, Ian McEwan),
giving the readers something to talk about I guess. I didn't find it
necessary, rather almost gratuitous.

Protagonist, Max Morden, recently lost his wife. Still in mourning,
and probably in an attempt to distract himself, he revisits another
traumatic event, something that happened one summer in his youth.
