_Translated by Stanley Appelbaum_

_April 2016_

All very bizarre stories -- the plot is clear, but the intent is
baffling.


- _The Judgement_: a man inexplicably condemned by his father, commits
  suicide in the river.
- _The Metamorphosis_: a traveling sales man, at home, wakes up as
  a cockroach.
- _In the Penal Colony_: an explorer, newly arrived in a penal colony,
  is to observe an execution by a locally invented contraption.
- _A Country Doctor_: surreal events occur as a country doctor needs
  to make a late night visit.
 - _A Report to an Academy_: an ape gives a speech about his
   humanization.
