Seems to be very reactionary, very much in response to the criticisms
of and general low esteem Lawrence was held at the time. T.S. Eliot
was one outspoken critic, and Leavis spends a considerable number of
pages tracing and rebutting his opinion.

The reactionary nature, to my mind, at times, appears to lead Leavis
astray. For example, when trying to address the criticism that
Lawrence has no sense of humour, Leavis argues that Lawrence is an
exceptional _comic_ writer.

On all other points though, I'm am more than sympathetic with Leavis'
position and was surprised at some of the criticisms leveled at
Lawrence, which are so contrary to how I perceive Lawrence and his
work. (TODO examples please)
