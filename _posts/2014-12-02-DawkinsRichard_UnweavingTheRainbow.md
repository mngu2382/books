In this book Dawkins aims to dispel the idea that science is unpoetic
or anti-poetic, removing the mystery and awe that we have for physical
events by explaining them. It is the example of Keats blaming Newton
for destroying the poetry of the rainbow by explaining it in terms of
prismatic colours which is alluded to by the title.

Dawkins argues that humans have a natural appetite for wonder, a
poetic appetite, which can led people to mysticism and superstition,
but which real science is equally capable of feeding.

This book is essentially a popular science book (albeit, written in
Dawkins literary style) which is not a genre that I generally go in
for. Probably more interesting for readers without much of a
science background.

__Aside__: This anecdote:
