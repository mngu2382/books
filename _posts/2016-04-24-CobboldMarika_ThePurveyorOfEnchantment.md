_April 2016_

A soppy romance novel, ridiculous and vapid -- Cobbold's attempt at a
writing a modern fairy tale it would seem.

Clementine Hope, mid-thirties, an obsessive compulsive worrier,
inherits a house, teaches piano, collects fairy tales and spends a lot
of time eating chocolate cake at the local cafe. Falls in love with
her neighbour at first sight, a literal breathless infatuation.

Wanted to throw the book in angry disgust at times.
