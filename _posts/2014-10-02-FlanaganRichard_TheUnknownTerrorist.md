Simply told and similar to
[Arthur & George]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/BarnesJulian_ArthurAndGeorge.html)
in that narration/perspective is shared among the major characters.

Flanagan carries a moralizing tone throughout, very overbearing and
slightly obnoxious, especially as I found it incongruous that he
allows his characters to have these apprently philosophical views and
yet have them carry on in their senselessly, almost shameless, shallow
behaviour. Not to mention that I think Flanagan exaggerates societies
excesses to make his point.

Finally, the Doll is surely as insane as Doris Lessing's
Good Terrorist.

__Aside:__ The book was
[reviewed by the First Tuesday Book Club](http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s1779003.htm#transcript),
where Germaine Greer really lays into the book. Although Greer is her
usual inflammatory self, I do agree with her substantives points.
