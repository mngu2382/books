_October 2015_

We follow Larry, from a 26 year old florist to a 46 year old
landscaping designer specializing in garden mazes, through a series of
15 episodes, almost individual standing short stories.

Although not an overly eventful, Shields expertly enlists our empathy
for the prosaic triumphs and struggles.

A solidly enjoyable book and a very nice restatement of the theme at
the end.
