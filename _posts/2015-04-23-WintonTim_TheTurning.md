_April, 2015_

A collection of short stories with recurring characters and scenes
based around the fictional towns of Angelus and White Point in Western
Australia.

After reading
[_The Lemon Table_]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes/BarnesJulian_TheLemonTable.html),
_The Turning_, to me, feels much more vital, in the sense that its
characters are instilled with more life. More vital also in the sense
that the stories have a greater insistence that they be told, as if in
the telling they become the means of catharsis not only for the reader
but their characters also.

Usually short stories leave me a bit dissatisfied, feeling a bit
wanting, just because I want to know more about the characters (at
least for the better stories). In this sense, _The Turning_ feels more
like a novel, as recurring characters and events allows the reader piece
together a powerful narrative.
