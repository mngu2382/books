This unfinished tale follows our hero Chichikov as he travels the
Russian countryside attempting to purchase dead souls -- serfs, who
having died only since the last census and so still considered alive
for administrative purposes -- in the hope of making his fortune
exploiting some bureaucratic loophole. This plot, a "well known
contemporary anecdote" we are told in the introduction by Nikolay
Andreyev,is not developed but rather serves as a vehicle for the
author to satirize the various characters that populate Russia, and,
as the author puts it, to "project the whole boundless wealth of
Russian psychology".

Unfortunately, I suspect most of the wit was lost on me as the
objects of satire were too unfamiliar and distant for me to recognise.

The narration is conversational, reminiscent of Dickens, though unlike
Dickens, quickly became tiresome, especially as the author starts
indulging in frequent, uninteresting diversions (examples?).
