      <h1>Simone de Beauvoir: She Came To Stay</h1>

<img class="frontcover" src="/books/img/BeauvoirSimonede_SheCameToStay.jpg" alt="Front cover of Simone de Beauvoir: She Came To Stay" />

<p>A fictionalized recount of the trio that existed between Olga
Kosakievicz (to whom the book is dedicated), Sartre and de Beauvoir
and narrated from the latter’s point of view.</p>

<p>Fay Weldon in an afterword for this edition of the book writes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It quite takes your breath away with its particular mixture of pain,
excitement and description …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This line struck me, as it resonated sympathetically with my own
response to the book, though I would go further and say that I found
the book suffocating. The fraught dynamic, where one of the trio’s
mood swings from self-satisfaction to distress through minor gesture
or off-the-cuff reply from another of the trio, of both the innocent
and malicious kind, that I continually found frustratingly
unfathomable.</p>

<p>Although de Beauvoir’s unfliching protrayal of the trio is very
admirable, I could not find reading the novel a satisfying experience.</p>

<p><strong>Aside:</strong> Poor print quality.</p>
