<blockquote>
  <p>This book is giving you a sacred technology, by which you can
transform not only your present life and not only your dying and
your death, but also your future lives, and so the future of
humanity. What my masters and I are hoping to inspire here is a
major leap forward towards the conscious evolution of humanity. To
learn how to live is to learn how to act not only in this life, but
in the life to come. To transform yourself truly and learn how to be
reborn as a transformed being to help others is really to help the
world in the most powerful way of all. (TODO: page number – among
the last paragraphs.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us are unprepared for death. In the Buddhist sense, this is
much more that about being at peace with oneself and the world at the
moment of death (although hugely important). In the process of death
one’s soul goes through a series stages, the manner in which one faces
these stages (along with one’s karma) determine the quality of one’s
rebirth.</p>

<p>The person that is dying is pretty much the same person as they have
lived: though the strength of habit, our reactions to event in death
would be the same reactions to similar events while living. On this
basis, the first part of the book describes the accumulated Buddhist
wisdom of how life should be lived.</p>
