      <h1>Julian Barnes: Arthur & George</h1>

<img class="frontcover" src="/books/img/BarnesJulian_ArthurAndGeorge.jpg" alt="Front cover of Julian Barnes: Arthur & George" />

<p><em>September, 2014</em></p>

<p>Great story, simply and compellingly told.</p>

<p>Base on the case of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Edalji">George Edalji</a> and
Arthur Conan Doyle’s involvement. Certainly, the book became much more
interesting upon the realization that Arthur was the A.C. Doyle and
the unfolding drama based on true events.</p>

<p><strong>Aside:</strong> The book reproduces an anecdote recorded by Doyle, told by
Wilde at a dinner party they both attended:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were dicussing the cynical maximum that the good fortune of our
friends made us discontented. ‘The devil’, said Wilde, ‘was once
crossing the Lybian Desert, and he came upon a spot where a number
small fiends were tormenting a holy hermit. The sainted man easily
shook off their evil suggestions. The devil watch their failure
and then he stepped forward to give them a lesson. “What you do is
too crude,” said he. “Permit me for one moment.”  With that he
whispered to the holy man, “Your brother has just been made Bishop
of Alexandria.” A scowl of malignat jealousy at once clouded the
serene face of the hermit. “That,” said the devil to his imps, “is
the sort of thing which I should recommend”.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This anecdote can be found in Doyle’s autobiography<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> which is
preceeded by another gem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Wilde] towered above us all, and yet he had the art of seeming to
be interested in all we could say. He had the delicacy of feeling
and tact, for the monologue man, however clever, can never be a
gentleman at heart. He took as well as he gave, but what he gave was
unique. He had a curious precision of statement, a delicate flavour
of humour, and a trick of small gestures to illustrate his meaning,
which were peculiar to himself. The effect cannot be reporduced, but
in dicussing the wars of the future he said: ‘A chemist from each
side will approach the frontier with a bottle’ – his upraised hand
and precise face conjuring up a vivid and grotesque picture.</p>
