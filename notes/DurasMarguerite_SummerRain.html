 <h1>Marguerite Duras: Summer Rain</h1>

<img class="frontcover" src="/books/img/DurasMarguerite_SummerRain.jpg" alt="Front cover of Marguerite Duras: Summer Rain" />

<p><em>Translated by Barbara Bray</em></p>

<p><em>October 2015</em></p>

<p>This novella centres around an unusual family living in Vitry. The
parents, immigrants, are shamelessly unemployed, and their seven
children, unschooled, unoccupied, in the main left to their own
devices. But this is not a dysfunctional family, rather, in fact, a
deeply loving one, and though uneducated, all members, even among the
youngest of brothers and sisters, instinctually wise.</p>

<p>I would place this book near the intersection of Gibran and Hesse in
terms of style. Presenting almost like a parable – though not with
any discernible lesson – its characters are not in any sense
realistic. In its unadorned sentences and in the conversations of its
characters, it exhibits a mistrust of the ability of words to express
its intentions, nevertheless, strives to evoke its meaning through the
careful curation of its lines.</p>

<p>I have not been so excited to discover an author in a long time.</p>
