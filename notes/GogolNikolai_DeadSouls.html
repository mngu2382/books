 <h1>Nikolay Gogol: Dead Souls</h1>

<img class="frontcover" src="/books" alt="" />

<p><em>Translated by D. J. Hogarth</em></p>

<p><em>September 2015</em></p>

<p>This unfinished tale follows our hero Chichikov as he travels the
Russian countryside attempting to purchase dead souls – serfs, who
having died only since the last census and so still considered alive
for administrative purposes – in the hope of making his fortune
exploiting some bureaucratic loophole. This plot, a “well known
contemporary anecdote” we are told in the introduction by Nikolay
Andreyev, is not developed but rather serves as a vehicle for the
author to satirize the various characters that populate Russia, and,
as the author puts it, to “project the whole boundless wealth of
Russian psychology”.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I suspect most of the wit was lost on me as the
objects of satire were too unfamiliar and distant for me to recognise.</p>

<p>The narration is conversational, reminiscent of Dickens, though unlike
Dickens, quickly became tiresome, especially as the author starts
indulging in frequent, uninteresting diversions (examples?).</p>
