      <h1>John Banville: The Sea</h1>

<img class="frontcover" src="/books/img/BanvilleJohn_TheSea.jpg" alt="Front cover of John Banville: The Sea" />

<p><em>May, 2014</em></p>

<p>Ornate language. The quote by Martin Amis of the cover resonates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is a master, and his prose gives continuous sensual delight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At times though, instead of being involved and delighted by the
writing, I find myself dis-involved and thinking “I see what you’re
trying to do here”, experiences I had before (<em>Seek My Face</em>, John
Updike and <em>Be Near Me</em>, Andrew O’Hagan) and a distraction from any
enjoyment.</p>

<p>With a intriguing twist right at the end (cf. <em>Atonement</em>, Ian McEwan),
giving the readers something to talk about I guess. I didn’t find it
necessary, rather almost gratuitous.</p>

<p>Protagonist, Max Morden, recently lost his wife. Still in mourning,
and probably in an attempt to distract himself, he revisits another
traumatic event, something that happened one summer in his youth.</p>
