 <h1>Jean Racine: Phaedra and Other Plays</h1>

<p><em>Translated by John Cairncross</em></p>

<p><em>October 2015</em></p>

<p>The three tragedies collected here are <em>Iphigenia</em>, <em>Phaedra</em> and
<em>Athaliah</em>, although I would say that only <em>Phaedra</em> is at all tragic
and consequently a much more interesting piece than the other two.</p>

<p><strong>Iphigenia</strong> The Greek host and their thousand ships, under the
command of Agamemnon and bound for Troy, for the last 6 months have
been beached on the island of Aulis. The unfavourable winds that keep
them there have sowed and breed disquiet among the idle Greeks. The
appeasement of the gods, spake the oracle, demands the sacrifice of
Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon and betrothed of Achilles. (Surely,
Stannis Baratheon’s sacrifice of his daughter is a reference to this
myth.)</p>

<p><strong>Phaedra</strong> The Queen of Athens is wasting away: while the fate of
King Theseus, attendant on some quest, is uncertain, her guilty
passion for her step-son Hippolytus grows unbridled. So distraught,
news arrives of Theseus’ undoing and Phaedra is persuaded to seize
this chance and professes to Hippolytus. She does so and is spurned.
But, lo, the King is not dead and is expected to arrive presently.</p>

<p><strong>Athaliah</strong> is the Queen of Judah. Reigning for the last eight years,
after seizing power for herself by ordering the death of her own
grandchildren following the unexpected death of her son, then king,
and so ending the line of King David. Unknown to all but the high
priest of Jerusalem, a child of the royal line does survive.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the verse translation, the lines come off quite
prosaic. (Would be interested in getting my hands of Robert Lowell’s
translation of Phaedra.)</p>

<p><strong>Aside</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cairncross">John Cairncross</a>
appears to be an interesting character with an unexpected background.</p>
