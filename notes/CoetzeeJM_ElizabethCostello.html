<p><em>November, 2013</em></p>

<p>A collection of short stories about preemminent and aging author
(like Coetzee himself) Elizabeth Costello. Not particularly impressed
with the writing, seems that the stories are much more focused on
enunciating ideas, most notably on livestock welfare, but also religon
and protraying evil in literature.</p>

<p>I hardly ever empathized with Costello. But the stories that I enjoyed
the most where the ones that included Costello’s son or her sister,
where the relationship and interaction between Costello and her family
really brings out, with dramatic power, the complexity of her character.
At other time she doesn’t come across as much more than a grumpy old
lady.</p>
